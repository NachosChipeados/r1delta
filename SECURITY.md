If you discover a security vulnerability within r1delta (or any of its subprojects):

1. Please report it responsibly in our [Discord server](https://discord.r1delta.net) by mentioning a contributor.

2. Provide sufficient information to reproduce and understand the issue (this includes logs, screen recordings, etc.).

3. Allow reasonable time for us to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.


Thank you for practicing responsible disclosure.
