# Disclaimer
This is a development preview (a.k.a beta) where things may and WILL break over time and features that you might see in-game might not be available in the future.

# Requirements

- The files `GBClient.dll`, `nmcogame64.dll`, `engine.dll`, `server_local.dll` and `tier0.dll` downloaded from [here](https://github.com/r1delta/r1delta/files/13839300/Bin_2.zip).

# Instructions
It's recommended if you don't know what you're doing to use the [R1Delta Installer](https://github.com/r1delta/r1delta_installer/releases).

You can install the project yourself by [compiling the code](https://github.com/r1delta/r1delta/tree/main#installing-r1delta-by-compiling-the-code) or [downloading from releases](https://github.com/r1delta/r1delta/tree/main#installing-r1delta-via-releases).

# Installing R1Delta via Releases
You can find the latest release of R1Delta by clicking [here](https://github.com/r1delta/r1delta/releases/). You need to download `r1delta_full-build.zip`, everything you need is already packed into the .zip file for your comfort.

You are also provided with the `r1delta_minimal-build.zip` if you don't want 3rd party .dlls included (you'll need to apply these manually later on.), in such case, click [here](#instructions-for-the-minimal-zip-release) for the instructions.

If you aren't using Origin, you'll also want to download the `Titanfall.exe` provided and replace the one in your Titanfall installation with it and then run the game with the launch arguments `-noorigin`.

Once you downloaded the .zip file, follow these instructions:
1) Locate your Titanfall installation directory, this is usually one of the following paths:
    - `C:\Program Files\EA Games\Titanfall`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Titanfall`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Titanfall`
    
    If `Titanfall.exe` is inside in one of those directories, that's the game directory.
2) Decompress all the .zip contents inside the game directory, replace all files when prompted.
3) Double-click r1delta.bat for launching R1Delta, or, add `-game r1delta -listenserver -multiple +fatal_script_errors 0` as launch parameters in your Origin/EA App/Steam client.
4) Success!

## Instructions for the minimal .zip release
If you decided to download the minimal .zip file instead of the full one, follow these instructions instead:

1) Locate your Titanfall installation directory, this is usually one of the following paths:
    - `C:\Program Files\EA Games\Titanfall`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Titanfall`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Titanfall`
    
    If `Titanfall.exe` is inside in one of those directories, that's the game directory.
2) Move the .dll files `GBClient.dll` and `nmcogame64.dll` that you downloaded earlier (check the [Requirements](#requirements) section for more info) inside the `bin\x64_retail` folder located within `Titanfall.exe`
3) Rename the `tier0.dll` that you downloaded earlier to `tier0_orig.dll` and move it into `bin\x64_retail` on your game directory
4) Go to your game directory, inside `bin\x64_retail` and rename `tier0.dll` to `tier0_r1.dll`
5) If you had BME installed, rename `launcher.dll` to `launcher.bme.dll` and rename `launcher.org.dll` to `launcher.dll`
6) Decompress all the minimal .zip contents inside the game directory, if you're prompted to replace any files, abort, verify game files and go again from step 1
7) Rename the `engine.dll` that you downloaded earlier to `engine_r1o.dll` and move it into `r1delta\bin\x64_delta` on your game directory
8) Move the `engine_ds.dll` that you downloaded earlier into `r1delta\bin\x64_delta` on your game directory
9) Rename the `server_local.dll` that you downloaded earlier to `server.dll` and move it into `r1delta\bin\x64_delta` on your game directory
9) Double-click r1delta.bat for launching R1Delta, or, add `-game r1delta -listenserver -multiple +fatal_script_errors 0` as launch parameters in your Origin/EA App/Steam client.
10) Success!

# Installing R1Delta by Compiling the code

5) If you had BME installed, rename `launcher.dll` to `launcher.bme.dll` and rename `launcher.org.dll` to `launcher.dll`
6) Install Visual Studio 2022, if you're unsure on how to do it, watch [this](https://youtu.be/1OsGXuNA5cc?t=98) video.

12) Uncompress `master.zip` and rename `core-master` folder to `r1delta`, then move it into your game directory.
13) Add `-game r1delta -listenserver -multiple +fatal_script_errors 0` as launch parameters in your Origin/EA App/Steam client.
14) Success!

If you aren't using Origin, you'll also want to download the `Titanfall.exe` provided in the releases, just drag and replace the one inside your Titanfall installation and run it with the launch arguments `-noorigin`.
